# LogViz
A tool to visualize log entries, recorded by the SD Logging special function
on an [EdgeTX](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx) B&W or color radio.

The tool was originally inspired by the  [LogViewerBW tool](https://github.com/nikbg3/EdgeTXLogViewerBW) by Nikolay Kolev but I wanted
to improve the user interface and simplify operation.

The script has been tested on the following radios:
- Radiomaster Zorro
- Horus X12S
- Horus X10S
- Taranis X7 ACCESS
- Taranis X9D+ 2019

**Author:** Roland Sch√§uble (icebreaker)

## Features and Operation
The start screen allows selection of Model, Logfile and Log-Entry (Field) to be visualized.
Navigation/Selection with the Rotary Wheel and ```Enter```.
Press ```Enter``` on ```View Log``` to display the selected entry. Only one entry can be selected/displayed at a time (memory limitations)

The cursor on the Log View screen can be moved (slowly) by turning the Rotary wheel or
(faster) by Stick #1 (Aileron).

When moving the cursor, the time stamp of the cursor position is displayed as a tooltip for 1 second.

To view the time stamp of the current cursor position, press ```Enter```

## Installation
Copy the file ```LogViz.lua``` and the folder ```LogViz``` to the ```/SCRIPTS/TOOLS``` folder on the SD card.
The directory structure should look like this afterwards:
```
/SCRIPTS/TOOLS
  Logviz.lua
  LogViz/
    button.lua
    logfile.lua
    logfiles.lua
    selector.lua
```
## Known problems
Due to memory limitations (especially on B&W Radios), it is possible, to run out of memory
when reading large Logfiles. However, Logfiles of 800k have been tested without problems.
